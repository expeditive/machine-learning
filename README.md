Welcome to my Machine Learning repository!  
This repo contains my journey through machine learning concepts, projects, experiments, and notes. 🚀

---

## 📌 About

This repository is a collection of:
- Core Machine Learning projects
- Practice notebooks and experiments
- Implementations of algorithms from scratch
- Explanations of important ML concepts (like Overfitting, Loss Functions, Bias-Variance Tradeoff, etc.)

My goal is to **build strong fundamentals** and **work on real-world projects** to master ML techniques.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Libraries Used

- **Python** 🐍
- **NumPy** (Numerical computations)
- **Pandas** (Data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** (Data visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning algorithms)
- **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch** (Deep Learning frameworks) *(upcoming)*
